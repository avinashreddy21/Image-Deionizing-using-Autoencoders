# Image-Deionizing-using-Autoencoders

In this project,
* Understand the theory and intuition behind Autoencoders
* Import Key libraries, dataset and visualize images
* Perform image normalization, pre-processing, and add random noise to images
* Build an Autoencoder using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend
* Compile and fit Autoencoder model to training data 
* Assess the performance of trained Autoencoder using various KPIs
